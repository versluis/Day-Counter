# Day-Counter
An iOS Project showing how to calculate the elapsed days from a start date.

I've created this little app to record long-term effects of a new thyroid medication I'm taking as part of my post-cancer treatment. 
The idea is that I can check how many days I've been taking it, and to state in a video record how I feel on any particular date.
Feel free to modify it to your own needs.

In its current form, the app displays a big label on the front, showing how many days have elapsed since a start date, 
which can be set in the settings view controller (edit button on the top right).

I'm building this code in a screencast - check it out here:

It's also available on YouTube in three parts:
* Part 1: https://youtu.be/YIKWqU6mhg8 (graphical setup in Interface Builder)
* Part 2: (calendar and date methods)
* Part 3: (Key Value Observing)

Enjoy, and Happy Hacking!
